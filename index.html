<h3>Interests:</h3>
<ul><li>I LOVE Game of Thrones!</li><br/> <span></span> I love the show as well as the book series. I probably spend more time in Westeros than I do the real world.<br/> I'd have to say my top 3 favorite characters in the series are Jon Snow of Winterfell, Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock and Oberyn Martell of Sunspear.

    <ul><br><li>Gaming<br/> I am super into gaming! I've been gaming since I was a kid. My favorite titles are Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, Assassins Creed and Red Dead Redemption.</li></ul>
